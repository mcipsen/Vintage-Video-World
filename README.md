# Vintage-Video-World
Odin Project practice project. Vintage video equipment database and marketplace.

The goal of this project is to complete a landing site using the HTML and CSS concepts I've learned so far in this course. I'll lay out the content in HTML, then use CSS and flexbox to style and arrange the content on the page.
